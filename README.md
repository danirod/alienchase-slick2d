# Alien Chase (Slick2D)

This is the source code for the original Alien Chase made for my Slick2D tutorials. They can be seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL173D1B442B7F4C3F](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL173D1B442B7F4C3F).

This source code is old and legacy and hasn't been updated in a while. Slick2D hasn't either. This project uses LWJGL 2.x, which is deprecated now.

## How to run

Get the code, including lib/ and natives/ folder. Add the JARs in lib/ as Java libraries. LWJGL requires the native libraries located in natives/ in order to run. The process depends on each IDE.

## No comments?!

I lost the original source code. What you have here is the decompiled code from a compiled JAR I still kept around. I decompiled the code, checked it was good and packed it into an Eclipse project.

## TODO?

* Maybe move to Gradle?
* If move to Gradle is successful, maybe remove lib/ and natives/ and use Gradle?
